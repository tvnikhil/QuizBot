It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.”\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths\n\n### Example 2\n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\nThey were no longer mere operatives; they had become guardians of a threshold, keepers of a message from a realm beyond stars and stripes. This elevation in their mission could not be shackled by regulations and established protocols—it demanded a new perspective, a new resolve.\n\nTension threaded through the dialogue of beeps and static as communications with Washington buzzed in the background. The team stood, a portentous air enveloping them. It was clear that the decisions they made in the ensuing hours could redefine humanity's place in the cosmos or condemn them to ignorance and potential peril.\n\nTheir connection to the stars solidified, the group moved to address the crystallizing warning, shifting from passive recipients to active participants. Mercer's latter instincts gained precedence— the team's mandate had evolved, no longer solely to observe and report but to interact and prepare. A metamorphosis had begun, and Operation: Dulce hummed with the newfound frequency of their daring, a tone set not by the earthly\n\n### Example 3\n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\ntheir voice slicing through the buzz of activity. \"Control may be an illusion when facing an intelligence that literally writes its own rules,\" they stated stoically, casting a watchful eye over the flurry of data.\n\n\"It's like it's learning to communicate,\" offered Sam Rivera from a nearby interface, their youthful energy boding a mix of awe and anxiety. \"This gives talking to strangers' a whole new meaning.\"\n\nAlex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. \"This might well be our first contact,\" he acknowledged, \"And we need to be ready for whatever answers back.\"\n\nTogether, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.\n\nThe encrypted dialogue continued to unfold, its intricate patterns showing an almost uncanny anticipation\n\n### Real Data\n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\nInput: Some truly random bits\nPRNG.Generate(n): Generate n pseudorandom bits\nInput: A number n\nOutput: n pseudorandom bits\nUpdates the internal state as needed\nProperties\nCorrectness: Deterministic\nEfficiency: Efficient to generate pseudorandom bits\nSecurity: Indistinguishability from random\nRollback resistance: cannot deduce anything about any previously-generated bit\n\n### Stream Ciphers\n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\na proprietary cipher designed in 1987 \nExtremely simple but effective!\nVery fast - especially in software\nEasily adapts to any key length, byte-oriented\n\nStream Cipher Properties\nStatistically random \nDepends on large enough key\nLarge linear complexity\nCorrelation immunity\nConfusion\nDiffusion\n\n### How to generate Stream Key?\n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\nHow to generate Stream Key?\n\n\n### Stream Ciphers \n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\nIdea: replace “rand” by “pseudo rand”\nUse Pseudo Random Number Generator \nA secure PRNG produces output that looks indistinguishable from random\nAn attacker who can’t see the internal PRNG state can’t learn any output\nPRNG: {0,1}s ® {0,1}n\nExpand a short (e.g., 128-bit) random seed into a long (typically unbounded) string that “looks random”\nSecret key is the seed\nBasic encryption method: Ekey[M] = M Å PRNG(key)\n\n\n### Stream Ciphers \n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\nProtocol: Alice and Bob both seed a secure PRNG with their \nsymmetric secret key, and then use the output as the key for stream \nkey\nAlice\nBob\nSeed(k)\nGenerate(n)\nGenerate(n)\nPlaintext\nPlaintext\nCiphertext\n⊕\n\n\n### Stream Ciphers: Encrypting Multiple Messages\n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\nHow do we encrypt multiple messages without key reuses?\nAlice\nBob\nSeed(k)\nSeed(k)\nGenerate(n)\nGenerate(n)\nPlaintext\nPlaintext\nCiphertext\n⊕",

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.”\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths\n\n### Example 2\n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\nThey were no longer mere operatives; they had become guardians of a threshold, keepers of a message from a realm beyond stars and stripes. This elevation in their mission could not be shackled by regulations and established protocols—it demanded a new perspective, a new resolve.\n\nTension threaded through the dialogue of beeps and static as communications with Washington buzzed in the background. The team stood, a portentous air enveloping them. It was clear that the decisions they made in the ensuing hours could redefine humanity's place in the cosmos or condemn them to ignorance and potential peril.\n\nTheir connection to the stars solidified, the group moved to address the crystallizing warning, shifting from passive recipients to active participants. Mercer's latter instincts gained precedence— the team's mandate had evolved, no longer solely to observe and report but to interact and prepare. A metamorphosis had begun, and Operation: Dulce hummed with the newfound frequency of their daring, a tone set not by the earthly\n\n### Example 3\n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\ntheir voice slicing through the buzz of activity. \"Control may be an illusion when facing an intelligence that literally writes its own rules,\" they stated stoically, casting a watchful eye over the flurry of data.\n\n\"It's like it's learning to communicate,\" offered Sam Rivera from a nearby interface, their youthful energy boding a mix of awe and anxiety. \"This gives talking to strangers' a whole new meaning.\"\n\nAlex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. \"This might well be our first contact,\" he acknowledged, \"And we need to be ready for whatever answers back.\"\n\nTogether, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.\n\nThe encrypted dialogue continued to unfold, its intricate patterns showing an almost uncanny anticipation\n\n### Real Data\n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\nInput: Some truly random bits\nPRNG.Generate(n): Generate n pseudorandom bits\nInput: A number n\nOutput: n pseudorandom bits\nUpdates the internal state as needed\nProperties\nCorrectness: Deterministic\nEfficiency: Efficient to generate pseudorandom bits\nSecurity: Indistinguishability from random\nRollback resistance: cannot deduce anything about any previously-generated bit\n\n### Stream Ciphers\n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\na proprietary cipher designed in 1987 \nExtremely simple but effective!\nVery fast - especially in software\nEasily adapts to any key length, byte-oriented\n\nStream Cipher Properties\nStatistically random \nDepends on large enough key\nLarge linear complexity\nCorrelation immunity\nConfusion\nDiffusion\n\n### How to generate Stream Key?\n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\nHow to generate Stream Key?\n\n\n### Stream Ciphers \n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\nIdea: replace “rand” by “pseudo rand”\nUse Pseudo Random Number Generator \nA secure PRNG produces output that looks indistinguishable from random\nAn attacker who can’t see the internal PRNG state can’t learn any output\nPRNG: {0,1}s ® {0,1}n\nExpand a short (e.g., 128-bit) random seed into a long (typically unbounded) string that “looks random”\nSecret key is the seed\nBasic encryption method: Ekey[M] = M Å PRNG(key)\n\n\n### Stream Ciphers \n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\nProtocol: Alice and Bob both seed a secure PRNG with their \nsymmetric secret key, and then use the output as the key for stream \nkey\nAlice\nBob\nSeed(k)\nGenerate(n)\nGenerate(n)\nPlaintext\nPlaintext\nCiphertext\n⊕\n\n\n### Stream Ciphers: Encrypting Multiple Messages\n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText:\nHow do we encrypt multiple messages without key reuses?\nAlice\nBob\nSeed(k)\nSeed(k)\nGenerate(n)\nGenerate(n)\nPlaintext\nPlaintext\nCiphertext\n⊕",

    "return": "Here are five open-ended questions with possible correct answers:\n\n**Question 1**\nWhat are some potential limitations of using a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) to generate random numbers for cryptographic purposes?\n\n**Possible Correct Answer:** One potential limitation of using a PRNG is that it does not provide true randomness, which can be difficult to detect and exploit in certain situations. Another limitation is that PRNGs are typically designed to produce output within a specific range or pattern, making them less suitable for applications where truly random numbers are required.\n\n**Question 2**\nDescribe the key components of an authenticated encryption scheme, including the encryption algorithm, key generation procedure, and verification process.\n\n**Possible Correct Answer:** An authenticated encryption scheme consists of several key components: (1) a symmetric encryption algorithm such as AES-CBC, (2) a key generation procedure that produces a secret key, and (3) a verification process that checks whether the received ciphertext matches the expected output based on the shared secret key.\n\n**Question 3**\nExplain the concept of homomorphic encryption and its applications in secure computation. Provide examples of how it can be used to perform computations on encrypted data without decrypting it first.\n\n**Possible Correct Answer:** Homomorphic encryption is a cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed on ciphertext data without decrypting it first, enabling secure computation and data processing. Examples of how homomorphic encryption can be applied include online banking systems where transactions are processed in parallel, and cloud computing services where sensitive data can be stored and processed securely.\n\n**Question 4**\nDescribe the key differences between public-key cryptography (e.g., RSA) and symmetric-key cryptography (e.g., AES). Explain when each type of cryptography is more suitable for a particular application.\n\n**Possible Correct Answer:** Public-key cryptography uses pair of keys, one for encryption (public key) and one for decryption (private key), which enables secure data transmission and computation. Symmetric-key cryptography uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, making it faster but less secure than public-key cryptography. Public-key cryptography is more suitable for applications where high security and reliability are required, such as online transactions and secure communication, while symmetric-key cryptography is more suitable for applications that require fast data processing, such as cloud computing.\n\n**Question 5**\nCompare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of digital signatures (e.g., RSA) and message authentication codes (MACs). Explain how they can be used to verify the integrity and authenticity of data in a secure manner.\n\n**Possible Correct Answer:** Digital signatures use asymmetric cryptography to encode a message with a public key, while message authentication codes (MACs) use symmetric cryptography to generate a checksum or hash value from the encrypted message. While digital signatures provide strong authentication and integrity guarantees, they are vulnerable to side-channel attacks if the private key is compromised. On the other hand, MACs are more secure against side-channel attacks but may not provide the same level of authenticity as digital signatures.",
